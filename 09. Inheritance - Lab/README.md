## Part I: Inheritance

## **01.	Single Inheritance -** [Solution](https://github.com/elenaborisova/Python-OOP/blob/main/09.%20Inheritance%20-%20Lab/01_single_inheritance.py)
Create two classes named Animal and Dog.  
Animal with a single public method eat() that returns: "eating…"  
Dog with a single public method bark() that returns: "barking…"  
Dog should inherit from Animal.  

## **02.	Multiple Inheritance -** [Solution](https://github.com/elenaborisova/Python-OOP/blob/main/09.%20Inheritance%20-%20Lab/02_multiple_inheritance.py)
Create three classes named Person, Employee and Teacher.   
Person with a single public method sleep() that returns: "sleeping..."  
Employee with a single public method get_fired() that returns: "fired..."  
Teacher with a single public method teach() that returns: "teaching..."  
Teacher should inherit from Person and Employee.  

## **03.	Hierarchical Inheritance -** [Solution](https://github.com/elenaborisova/Python-OOP/blob/main/09.%20Inheritance%20-%20Lab/03_hierarchical%20inheritance.py)
Create three classes named Animal, Dog and Cat.   
Animal with a single public method eat() that returns: "eating..."  
Dog with a single public method bark() that returns: "barking..."  
Cat with a single public method meow() that returns: "meowing..."  
Dog and Cat should inherit from Animal.  


## Part II: Reusing Classes

## **04.	Random List -** [Solution](https://github.com/elenaborisova/Python-OOP/blob/main/09.%20Inheritance%20-%20Lab/04_random_list.py)
Create a RandomList class that has all the functionality of a List.  
Add additional function that returns and removes a random element from the list.  
•	Public method: get_random_element()  

## **05.	Stack of Strings -** [Solution](https://github.com/elenaborisova/Python-OOP/blob/main/09.%20Inheritance%20-%20Lab/05_stack_of_strings.py)
Create a class Stack which can store only strings and has the following functionality:  
•	Public field: data: list  
•	Public method: push(item)  
•	Public method: pop()  
•	Public method: peek()  
•	Public method: is_empty(): returns boolean   
Override the string method to return the stack data.
